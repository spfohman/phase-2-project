# About Me App

I built this app using React, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML for phase two at the Flatiron School.

The landing page or Home page gives brief information about me along with a clickable button that shows contact information along with links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts.

I also did useEffect to fetch an external API to render [random cat](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search) images to the home page.

From home there are two other page redirects to a page of my blog posts, and then a page where new blog posts can be added.

The Blog Posts page lists each blog post in its own card with the date posted, the title, a link to the external site on Medium, and a button which renders the number of likes each post has. The like button can be clicked and the count will persist to the db.json server.

The Blog Upload page is a form where the blog title, date of posting, and web url can be entered. This information will then be sent to the json server and the new item will be added once the submit button is clicked. This also triggers a re-direct to the Blog Posts page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
